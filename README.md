# This is a Readme file and cry for help at the same time 


## Fun  issues future me has to deal with (Not looking forward to it ) 
- Some text is not auto sixing correctly
 old problems are replaced by new ones (just line in real life )

Name of this extension is 
**New Tab Redirect**
chrome://extensions/?id=icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna
 this extension abondoned me  just like everyone else

 use the alternative for better results  

## Alternatives : 
- i am using this instead  (HAVE TO TEST THIS ONE FOR FUNCTONALITY AND STABILITY )
[Fast New tab redirect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ohnfdmfkceojnmepofncbddpdicdjcoi)


here is another  option 
[Custom New tab on google webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab/lfjnnkckddkopjfgmbcpdiolnmfobflj)


## Todo: 
- add a way to enter one command and have it open multiple links for me 
Example : 
 1. enter ./ai and it opens ai websites i use for research 
2. enter ./news to open your news websites 
3. enter ./social to launch whatsapp web ,reddit - discord etc 

- Design this page better with custom icons and better dashbaord (maybe will make a new repo for that)

## Fun  issues future me has to deal with (Not looking forward to it ) 

- Issues draining my brain cells 
this fun extension to redirect the new tab when  i press ``CTRL+T`` decided to stop working after Chrome Update 

- This extension is the most robust one i could find for now 
- This is working on other  chromium based browsers (I tried this on the thorium broswer and it worked) 
- Google Please stop this madness 

Name of this extension is 
**New Tab Redirect**

## Todo: 
- add a way to enter one command and have it open multiple links for me 
Example : 
 1. enter ./ai and it opens ai websites i use for research 
2. enter ./news to open your news websites 
3. enter ./social to launch whatsapp web ,reddit - discord etc
